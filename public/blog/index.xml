      <description>When we talk about the one person whom I&amp;rsquo;d like to become, I find it really troubling to choose any one person. I&amp;rsquo;ve been really grateful to have met a lot of people who have taught me a great deal.

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re here, it means that probably you&amp;rsquo;ve come across functional programming or Clojure. If not, perhaps I need to check my SEO. Anyway, let&amp;rsquo;s make the most out of it. Throughout the blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to simplify and present my understanding of the Functional Programming and Clojure. When you&amp;rsquo;re getting started with Clojure, the book Brave Clojure is going to be your life saver. Joy of Clojure is another book you&amp;rsquo;d find handy.</description>
